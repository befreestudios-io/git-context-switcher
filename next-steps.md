# Git Context Switcher - Next Steps

## Project Overview

Git Context Switcher is a tool that helps users switch between different Git configurations (personal, work, client projects, etc.) using Git's conditional includes feature. It creates and manages separate config files in the `.gitconfig.d` directory and updates the main `.gitconfig` with appropriate conditional includes.

## Current Status

- Version 1.1.0 released with new features
- Automatic context detection based on repository URL implemented
- Context templates for quick setup added
- Export/import contexts for sharing capability added
- Tests are in place

## Next Steps

1. **✅ Feature Enhancements** (v1.1.0) - COMPLETED

   - ✅ Add support for automatic context detection based on repository URL
   - ✅ Implement context templates for quick setup
   - ✅ Add ability to export/import contexts for sharing

2. **Performance Improvements** (v1.2.0)

   - Optimize file operations for large git config files
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed configs

3. **User Experience** (v1.3.0)
   - Improve CLI output with better formatting and colors
   - Add interactive mode for context setup
   - Implement context validation

### Low Priority

1. **Platform Specific Enhancements** (v1.4.0)

   - Add specific handling for Windows paths
   - Create installation scripts for different platforms

2. **Integration** (v1.5.0)
   - Create hooks for popular IDEs and editors
   - Add integration with other Git tools

## Version Planning

### Semantic Versioning Guidelines

- **MAJOR (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes that are not backward compatible
- **MINOR (0.X.0)**: New features that are backward compatible
- **PATCH (0.0.X)**: Bug fixes and minor improvements that are backward compatible

### Release Planning

1. **v1.0.x Patches**:

   - Bug fixes
   - Documentation improvements
   - Minor optimizations

2. **v1.1.0 - v1.5.0**:

   - Feature additions as outlined above
   - Each feature set should be released as a minor version increment

3. **v2.0.0 (Future)**:
   - Consider for any breaking changes to the API or CLI interface
   - Major architectural improvements

### Release Process

1. Update version in package.json
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with changes
3. Create git tag for the version
4. Push to GitHub
5. Publish to npm

## Notes

- Remember to follow security best practices when dealing with potentially sensitive git config data
- Keep the validation of path safety as a top priority
- Consider backward compatibility when making changes

## Implementation Decisions

- Continue using fs-extra for file operations due to its promise support and enhanced API
- Maintain ES modules pattern for better future compatibility
- Keep the configuration format simple and compatible with Git's native format
