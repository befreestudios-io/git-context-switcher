# Git Context Switcher - Next Steps

## Project Overview

Git Context Switcher is a tool that helps users switch between different Git configurations (personal, work, client projects, etc.) using Git's conditional includes feature. It creates and manages separate config files in the `.gitconfig.d` directory and updates the main `.gitconfig` with appropriate conditional includes.

## Current Status

- Basic functionality implemented
- File system operations working properly
- Tests are in place

## Next Steps

### High Priority

1. **Complete FileSystem service improvements**

   - Finish error handling improvements in the `_ensureTestDirectories` method
   - Add better error messaging for permission issues
   - Implement file locking for concurrent operations

2. **Documentation Enhancement**

   - Update README with more detailed examples
   - Add troubleshooting section
   - Document all available commands and options

3. **Testing**
   - Increase test coverage (aim for >80%)
   - Add more integration tests
   - Add tests for edge cases around file permissions

### Medium Priority

1. **Feature Enhancements**

   - Add support for automatic context detection based on repository URL
   - Implement context templates for quick setup
   - Add ability to export/import contexts for sharing

2. **Performance Improvements**

   - Optimize file operations for large git config files
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed configs

3. **User Experience**
   - Improve CLI output with better formatting and colors
   - Add interactive mode for context setup
   - Implement context validation

### Low Priority

1. **Platform Specific Enhancements**

   - Add specific handling for Windows paths
   - Create installation scripts for different platforms

2. **Integration**
   - Create hooks for popular IDEs and editors
   - Add integration with other Git tools

## Notes

- Remember to follow security best practices when dealing with potentially sensitive git config data
- Keep the validation of path safety as a top priority
- Consider backward compatibility when making changes

## Implementation Decisions

- Continue using fs-extra for file operations due to its promise support and enhanced API
- Maintain ES modules pattern for better future compatibility
- Keep the configuration format simple and compatible with Git's native format
